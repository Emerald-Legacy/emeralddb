                This document is intended as the definitive source for rules information, but does
                not teach players how to play the game. Players should first read the Learn to Play
                book in its entirety and use this Rules Reference as needed while playing the game.
              </p>
              <p>
                The majority of this guide consists of the glossary, which provides an alphabetical
                listing of terms and situations a player might encounter during a game. This section
                should be the first destination for players who have a rules question.
              </p>
              <p>
                The latter part of this guide contains two appendices. The first appendix provides
                detailed timing diagrams that illustrate the structure of an entire game round, as
                well as how to handle each game step presented in those diagrams. The second
                provides a detailed anatomy of each card type.

                While the rules presented in the Learn to Play book introduce the game’s primary
                stronghold format, there are many other formats that allow Legend of the Five Rings
                to be played in different unique ways. Currently there are four fully supported
                formats for the game, each with its own additional rules supplements which can be
                found online at www.L5R.com.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The stronghold format is a two-player head-to-head format in which players attempt
                  to break each others’ strongholds.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The skirmish format is a two-player head-to-head format in which players attempt
                  to break all three of their opponent’s provinces. No stronghold or province cards
                  are used in this format.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The enlightenment format is a three-player head-to-head format in which players
                  attempt to collect all five rings to achieve enlightenment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The team conquest format is a four-player head-to-head format in which two teams
                  attempt to destroy both of the opposing team’s strongholds.

                The following is an alphabetical list of entries for game rules, terms, and
                situations that may occur during play.

                <p>
                  An ability is the special game text that a card contributes to the game. Card
                  abilities fall into one of the following types: actions, constant abilities,
                  interrupts, keywords, and reactions. Some interrupt and reaction abilities are
                  also forced.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Card abilities only interact with, and can only target, cards that are in play,
                    unless the ability specifically refers to an out-of-play area or element. Card
                    abilities on characters, attachments, holdings, strongholds, and provinces can
                    only be initiated or affect the game while they are in play unless the ability
                    specifically refers to being used from an out-of-play area, or require that the
                    card be out of play for the ability to resolve. Event cards and role cards
                    implicitly interact with the game from an out-of-play area, as established by
                    the rules of their cardtypes.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The application or initiation of the following types of abilities is mandatory:
                    constant abilities, forced interrupt abilities, and forced reaction abilities.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The initiation of any keyword which uses the word "may" in its keyword
                    description is optional. The application of all other keywords is mandatory.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The initiation of action, interrupt, and reaction abilities is optional. The
                    word "may" also incorporates a player option into the resolution of an ability.
                    The player who controls the card on which an optional ability exists determines
                    whether or not he or she wishes to use that ability at the appropriate time.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    An ability prefaced by a bold-face timing trigger followed by a colon is
                    referred to as a "triggered ability."
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The controller of the card from which an ability is resolving makes all
                    decisions required by that ability's resolution unless another player is
                    specifed by the ability's text.

                  In some phases, the game creates an active player, who is granted permission to
                  perform a specified task.

                    play character cards from his or her provinces or initiate an action ability.
                    The status of active player alternates between players in this phase until all

                    initiated.

                  Some card abilities allow a player to declare an additional conflict during the
                  conflict phase. The additional conflict created by such an effect is in addition

                  Ancestral is a keyword ability that appears on attachments. If the card or game
                  element to which an ancestral attachment is attached leaves play, the ancestral
                  attachment is returned to its owner's hand instead of being discarded.

                  Attachment cards represent weapons, armor, items, skills, spells, conditions, and
                  titles. An attachment card enters play ready and attached to another card or game
                  element, and remains in play unless it is removed by an ability, or unless the
                  attached card leaves play.

                  <li>
                    An attachment a player controls remains under his or her control even if the

                    subset of cards can be attached to the same card or game element. If a second
                    card of that subset becomes attached to the card or game element, the
                    previously-attached card is discarded as the limit has been surpassed.

                  The term "attacking character" refers to a character that is participating in a
                  conflict on the side of the player who initiated the conflict. The term "attacker"
                  is also used as shorthand for "attacking character."

                  The term "attacking player" refers to the player that initiated the conflict that

                  If the attacking player wins a conflict with a total skill difference (between the

                  <li>
                    When a province is broken, the attacking player has the option of discarding any
                    dynasty cards in that province. If this option is taken, the province is
                    refilled facedown.

                    If a province breaks for any reason other than through standard conflict
                    resolution, the opponent of the player who controls that province is considered

                <p>
                  Cards often bow after participating in a conflict, to use card abilities, or as
                  the result of card or game effects. When a card is bowed, it is rotated 90
                  degrees. A card in this latter state is considered bowed.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    A bowed card cannot bow again until it is ready. Cards are typically readied by
                    a game step or card ability.
                  </li>
                  <li>During conflicts, bowed characters do not contribute their skill.</li>
                  <li>
                    A bowed attachment with skill modifiers still modifies the skill of the attached
                    character.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A card ability on a bowed card is active and can still engage with the game
                    state. However, if a bowed card must bow as part of its cost to trigger an
                    ability, it cannot bow again until it is readied, so the ability could not be
                    triggered.

                <p>
                  Some card abilities can "cancel" other card or game effects. Cancel abilities
                  interrupt the initiation of an effect, and prevent the effect from initiating.
                  Because of this, cancel abilities have timing priority over <em>all</em> other
                  interrupts to the effect that is attempting to initiate.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If an effect is canceled, that effect is no longer imminent, and further
                    interrupts (including cancels) cannot be initiated in reference to the canceled
                    effect.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If the effects of an ability are canceled, the ability is still considered to
                    have been used, and any costs have still been paid.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If the effects of an event card are canceled, the card is still considered to

                    If a ring effect that is resolving for winning a conflict is canceled, the ring

                    Characters played from a player’s provinces can only be played during the

                    When a player plays a character from his or her hand during a conflict, the

                  <li>
                    When a player plays a character in a team conquest format game, that player
                    chooses to either play it under their own control or under the control of a
                    teammate. Once played, control cannot be exchanged except by card effects. Fate
                    is placed on the character from the fate pool of the player playing the

                  Composure is a variable keyword ability. A card with this keyword gains an
                  additional ability while its controller’s honor bid is lower than that of one of
                  his or her opponents.

                  <li>
                    Most uses of the composure keyword grant a constant ability that modifies a
                    character’s skills or glory. Some may grant triggered abilities that can only be
                    used while a player has composure.

                  <li>
                    “You have composure" is the phrase indicating that a player’s composure keyword
                    is active. It is used in reminder text to indicate that a player’s card has the
                    ability granted by composure while their honor bid is lower than an opponent’s.

                  When a conflict is at multiple provinces, each of those provinces is the "attacked

                  A constant ability is any non-keyword ability whose text contains no boldface

                  A card's owner is the player who included the card as a part of his or her deck

                  of the game.

                  <li>
                    A player controls the cards in his or her out-of-play game areas (such as the

                  <li>
                    If a card would enter an out-of-play area of a player who does not own the card,
                    the card is placed in its owner's equivalent out-of-play area instead. (For all
                    associated card ability and framework effect purposes, the card is considered to
                    have entered that opponent's out-of-play area, and only the physical placement
                    of the card is adjusted.)

                  <li>
                    If a participating character changes control during a conflict, it is considered

                  A copy of a card is defined by title: any other card that shares the same title is
                  considered a copy, regardless of card type, text, deck of origin, artwork, or any
                  other characteristic(s) of the card(s).

                  Some card abilities may cause a character to become a copy of another character.
                  When that happens, the character that is changing loses its name, cost, base
                  skills and glory, traits, clan affiliation, and ability text. It gains the name,
                  cost, base skills and glory, traits, clan affiliation,and ability text of the
                  copied character for the duration indicated by the card ability.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Cards that refer to a character’s printed text (skills, traits, abilities, etc.)
                    still refer to the text physically printed on the card.

                  <li>
                    When a character becomes a copy of another character, only the base skills and
                    printed characteristics are copied. If the character that is changing gains
                    characteristics (such as traits or ability text) from another non-copy card
                    ability (such as an event or attachment) then those characteristics are not
                    lost.

                  <li>
                    A character can only become a copy of a unique character if its owner and/or
                    controller does not also own or control a copy (by title) of that unique
                    character.

                  <li>
                    Becoming a copy of another character replaces the character’s base skills and

                  Corrupted is a keyword ability. A character with the corrupted keyword enters play

                <p>
                  A card's cost is the numerical value that dictates how much fate must be paid to
                  play the card from a player's hand or provinces.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some triggered card abilities also have an ability cost. Any imperative
                  instruction (other than "choose...," which denotes one or more targets must be
                  chosen, or "select...," which denotes that one or more of a number of effects must
                  be selected) that appears before the dash of a triggered ability is considered a
                  part of that ability's cost. Some examples of ability cost instructions are:
                  "Bow...," "Spend...," "Sacrifice...," "Lose...," "Dishonor...," and "Discard...."
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Unless otherwise specified, a card effect that modifies a cost only modifies the
                    fate cost.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If a card has a dash as its printed fate cost, the card cannot be played. Its
                    printed fate cost is considered to be 0 for the purposes of card abilities which
                    require a numerical value.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When a player is paying a cost, the payment must be made with cards and/or game
                    elements that player controls. The word "friendly" is used as a reminder of this
                    in some costs.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If a cost requires a game element that is not in play, the player paying the
                    cost may only use game elements that are in his or her out-of-play areas or
                    token pools to pay the cost.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If multiple costs for a single card or ability require payment, those costs must
                    be paid simultaneously.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If any part of a cost payment is prevented, once all costs that can be paid are
                    paid, the process of initiating the ability or playing the card immediately ends
                    without further resolution. (If this occurs while playing a card, the card
                    remains unplayed in its owner's hand or province.)

                <p>
                  Covert is a keyword ability. When a player initiates a conflict, for each
                  character with the covert keyword he or she declares as an attacker, that player
                  may choose one character without covert controlled by the defending player. Each
                  chosen character is considered evaded by covert, and cannot be declared as a
                  defender for that conflict.

                  <li>
                    Card abilities may be used to move characters that have been evaded by covert

                  <li>
                    Covert may only be used when characters are declared as attackers. If a
                    character with covert is moved into or played into a conflict after the point at
                    which the conflict was declared, that character's covert ability does not
                    resolve.

                    When resolving an ability that references a "current" skill or glory count

                  In the text of a triggered ability, a dash (&ndash;) is used to separate the
                  criteria that are necessary to use the ability from the effect of the ability. Any
                  triggering conditions, play restrictions or permissions, costs, and targeting
                  requirements are denoted before the dash. The ability's effect is denoted after
                  the dash.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If a character has a dash (&ndash;) for a skill value, that character cannot
                  participate in, be played into, or be put into play in conflicts of that type.

                  <li>
                    Should a character with a dash skill value somehow end up participating in a
                    conflict of the corresponding type, that character is immediately removed from
                    the conflict, and placed in its controller's home area in a bowed state.

                  <li>
                    If a character has a dash for a skill value, that skill value cannot be modified

                  <li>
                    If a character has a dash for a skill value and a card ability requires a
                    numerical value for that skill, treat the card as if it had an unmodifiable
                    skill value of 0.

                  <li>

                <p>
                  The term "defending character" refers to a character that is participating in a

                  attacked. The term "defender" is also used as shorthand for "defending character."
                </p>
                <p>
                  The term "defending player" refers to the opponent of the attacking player against
                  whom (from the attacking player's perspective) a conflict is resolving.

                <p>
                  Some abilities contain delayed effects. Such abilities specify a future timing
                  point, or indicate a future condition that may arise, and dictate an effect that
                  is to happen at that time.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Delayed effects resolve automatically and immediately after their specified
                    timing point or future condition occurs or becomes true, before reactions to
                    that moment may be triggered.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When a delayed effect resolves, it is not treated as a new triggered ability,
                    even if the delayed effect was originally created by a triggered ability.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When a delayed effect resolves, it is still considered to be an ability
                    originating from the cardtype of the card that created the delayed effect.

                <p>
                  Dire is a variable keyword ability. A card with this keyword gains an additional
                  ability while that character has no fate on it.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Most uses of the dire keyword grant a constant ability that is active while the
                    character has no fate on it. Some may instead grant triggered abilities that can
                    only be used while the character has no fate on it.

                <p>
                  The discard piles are out-of-play areas. Each player has a dynasty discard pile
                  and a conflict discard pile.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Any time a card is discarded (from play, or from an out-of-play area such as a
                    hand or deck), it is placed faceup on top of its owner's appropriate discard
                    pile: dynasty cards are discarded to the dynasty discard pile, and conflict
                    cards are discarded to the conflict discard pile.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Each player's discard pile is open information, and may be looked at by any
                    player at any time.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The order of cards in a player's discard pile may be changed by that player.

                <p>
                  The disguised keyword appears on unique characters. When a character is played
                  using the disguised keyword, it replaces a non-unique character of the correct{' '}
                  <em>Trait</em> or clan affiliation, inheriting all of that character’s
                  attachments, fate, and status tokens. This is an alternate means by which to play
                  a character and carries a number of unique rules including, but not limited to, an
                  additional cost of choosing and discarding a non-unique character to discard when
                  the disguised character enters play.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    When playing a character using the disguised keyword, you may play that
                    character during the conflict phase, following all timing rules which apply to
                    playing characters from hand.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    To play a character using the disguised keyword, you must choose a non-unique
                    character you control of the appropriate
                    <em>Trait</em> or clan affiliation as an additional cost to play the character.
                    Reduce the cost to play the disguised character by the printed cost of the
                    chosen character, pay that cost, the disguised character enters play, then move
                    all attachments and tokens (fate, status, etc.) from the chosen character to the
                    disguised character. Finally, discard the chosen character from play. Interrupts
                    cannot be used to replace or prevent this discard.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A character played using the disguised keyword cannot be played into a conflict
                    unless the character chosen by the keyword was also participating in the
                    conflict, and fate from your fate pool cannot be put on it.

                  Some card abilities initiate a duel between two (or more) characters. For the
                  rules on how to initiate and resolve a duel, see "

                    Most card abilities that initiate a duel use the phrase “initiate a [type]
                    duel." The characters chosen during duel initiation are considered to be chosen
                    as targets of the ability that initiates the duel.

                <p>
                  A duplicate is a copy (in a player's hand or provinces) of a unique character that
                  is already in play and under the same player's control. A player may, as a player
                  action during step 1.4 of the dynasty phase, discard a duplicate from his or her
                  hand or provinces to place 1 fate on the copy of the character in play.
                </p>

                    After discarding a duplicate from a province, the province refills face down.

                  <li>
                    A different version of a unique card (that shares the same title) may be
                    discarded from a player's hand or provinces as a duplicate.

                <p>
                  A card effect is any effect that arises from the resolution of ability text
                  printed on or gained by a card. A framework effect is any effect that arises from
                  the resolution of a framework step.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Card effects might be preceded by costs, triggering conditions, play
                    restrictions or permissions, and/or targeting requirements. Such elements are
                    not considered effects.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Once an ability is initiated, players must resolve as much of each aspect of its
                    effect as they are able, unless the effect uses the word "may."
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When a non-targeting effect attempts to engage a number of entities (such as
                    "search the top 10 cards of your conflict deck") that exceeds the number of
                    entities that currently exist in the specified game area, the effect engages as
                    many entities as possible.

                  <li>
                    The expiration of a lasting effect (or the cessation of a constant ability) is
                    not considered to be generating a game state change by a card effect.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If an ability instructs a player to pick among multiple effects, an effect that
                    has the potential to change the game state must be picked.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Unless an effect uses the word “then" or the phrase “if you do," all effects of
                    a card ability are resolved simultaneously. The decision whether to resolve any
                    optional effects (usually indicated by the word “may") is made before applying
                    the results of the ability’s effects.

                <p>
                  Eminent is a keyword ability that can be found on province cards. A province with
                  this keyword cannot be a player’s stronghold province, starts the game faceup, and
                  cannot be turned facedown.

                <p>
                  The phrase "enters play" refers to any time a card makes a transition from an
                  out-of-play area or state into play. Playing a card and putting a card into play
                  by using a card ability are two means by which a card may enter play.

                <p>
                  Event cards represent tactical acts and maneuvers, court intrigues, spells,
                  supernatural occurrences, and other unexpected developments that might occur
                  during a game.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Event cards are triggered from a player's hand or provinces. An event card's
                    ability type, triggering condition (if any), and play permissions/restrictions
                    (if any), and originating location define when and how the card may be played.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Event cards with action abilities may be played from a player’s hand during any
                    action window.
                  </li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      In the skirmish format, event cards with action abilities cannot be played
                      from a player’s hand during the dynasty phase.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>
                    Event cards played from a player’s provinces cannot be played outside of the
                    dynasty phase.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When an event card is played, its costs are paid, its effects are resolved (or
                    canceled), and it is placed in its owner's appropriate discard pile prior to
                    opening the reaction window which follows the ability's resolution.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Lasting effects, including those created by event cards engage the game state at
                    the time they resolve. If an event card creates a lasting effect on a set of
                    cards, only cards that are in play (or in the affected game area or game state)
                    at the time the event is played are eligible to be affected. Cards that enter
                    play (or the affected game area or game state) after the resolution of the event
                    are not affected by its lasting effect.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If the effects of an event card are canceled, the card is still considered to
                    have been played, and its costs remain paid, and the card is still discarded.
                    Only the effects have been canceled.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Unless the ability that puts it into play also changes its cardtype to a
                    cardtype that is permitted in play, an event card cannot enter play.

                <p>
                  A facedown province card has no inherent identity other than "facedown province."
                  When a facedown province is turned faceup, that province card is considered to be
                  revealed.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    A facedown province is turned faceup when an attack is declared against it.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A player may look at the facedown provinces under his or her control at any
                    time.
                    <b>Note:</b> this rule refers to the facedown province card itself. A player is
                    not permitted to look at facedown dynasty cards in his or her provinces.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If a facedown province becomes the attacked province in a manner other than the
                    declaration of an attack, immediately turn the province faceup.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A facedown province is considered to be a different entity than its faceup side.
                    While a province is facedown, its faceup side is considered to be out of play.
                    When a province is turned faceup, the "faceup province" and "facedown province"
                    simultaneously exchange positions, such that the facedown province is now out of
                    play and the faceup province is now in play. The opposite is true when a
                    province is turned facedown.

                  <li>
                    Province tokens in the skirmish format are never considered to be facedown and
                    are never revealed.

                <p>
                  Fate is the game's basic resource, and is used to pay for cards and some card
                  abilities. The amount of fate a player has available at any given time is
                  represented (as open information) by fate tokens in his or her fate pool.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Fate begins the game in the general token pool. When a player gains fate, that
                    player takes that much fate from the general token pool and adds it to his or
                    her fate pool.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When a player is instructed to place fate on a card, that fate comes from the
                    general token pool unless otherwise specified.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When fate is spent or lost, it is usually returned to the general token pool. If
                    fate is spent to a ring, it is placed on that ring.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Whenever a player plays a character from his or her hand or provinces, after
                    that character enters play, that player has the option of placing any number of
                    fate from his or her fate pool onto that character.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    During the fate phase, each character with no fate on it is discarded.
                    Subsequently, 1 fate is removed from each character in play. Finally, 1 fate
                    from the general token pool is placed on each unclaimed ring.

                <p>
                  If a player is instructed to fill a province, that player takes the top card of
                  their dynasty deck and places it facedown (without looking at it) on the province.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    A player can fill a province even if that province already has 1 or more dynasty
                    cards in it.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If a player is instructed to fill a province faceup, the dynasty card is placed
                    in the province faceup rather than facedown.

                    During action windows, each team has an action opportunity (rather than each

                  While most triggered abilities are optional, some interrupt and reaction abilities
                  are preceded by the word "<b>Forced</b>." Such abilities must be resolved

                  <li>
                    If two or more forced and/or mandatory abilities (such as keywords) would
                    initiate at the same moment, the first player determines the order in which the
                    abilities initiate, regardless of who controls the cards bearing those
                    abilities.

                  <li>

                  When the players are asked to perform a glory count, each player or each team
                  counts the total glory value among the ready characters they control and adds 1 to

                  When a holding is turned faceup in a player's province, its game text becomes

                  remains faceup in a player's province, that player can use abilities or benefit

                    During the regroup phase, when discarding faceup cards from his or her
                    provinces, a player may choose to discard a faceup holding. When this occurs,
                    the province is refilled, facedown, with the top card of that player's Dynasty
                    deck, as normal.

                  Honor represents the behavior of a player's clan, and the outward perception of

                  <a href="#2-2-honor-bid">2.2. Honor bid</a>") and during duels. Honor also serves
                  as a victory track to measure an honor win or an honor loss. The amount of honor a
                  player has at any given time is represented (as open information) by honor tokens

                    is taken from the player's honor pool and returned to the general token pool.

                    If a card ability references a player who is more or less honorable than another

                    If a player is instructed to discard the Imperial Favor, that player returns the

                    In the skirmish format, the Imperial Favor is not set to a side as described
                    above. Instead, the +1 skill modifier granted by the Imperial Favor applies to
                    each conflict in which its bearer controls at least one participating character,
                    regardless of conflict type.

                  The cards (generally characters and attachments) that a player controls in his or
                  her play area (at home or participating in a conflict), a player's stronghold
                  card, a player's faceup province cards, and all holdings on a player's provinces
                  are considered "in play." A player's facedown provinces are considered in play
                  only as "facedown provinces," and the ability text on such cards is not considered
                  active until the card is revealed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Out-of-play" refers to all other cards and areas involved in the game
                  environment, including: character cards in a player's provinces, role cards, cards
                  in a player's hand, decks, discard piles, and any cards that have been removed
                  from the game.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    A card enters play when it transitions from an out-of-play origin to an in-play
                    state.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A card leaves play when it transitions from an in-play state to an out-of-play
                    destination.
                  </li>
                  <li>A player's stronghold cannot leave play.</li>
                  <li>
                    If a card enters or leaves play, any lasting effects, delayed effects, or
                    pending effects that are currently or about to interact with that card no longer
                    do so. This is also true if a card transitions from one out-of-play area to
                    another (such as going from hand to discard pile).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If a card would enter a deck of the incorrect deck type (conflict or dynasty),
                    it is put into the discard pile of its owner corresponding to its correct deck
                    type instead.

                  <li>

                  Influence is a deckbuilding resource that is indicated by a player's chosen
                  stronghold for that deck. Many conflict deck cards have an influence cost, which
                  makes them eligible for selection as an out-of-clan card.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the skirmish format, each player cannot spend more than 6 influence to include
                  out-of-clan cards in their deck.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    A player may spend influence up to the amount indicated by his or her stronghold
                    to include out-of-clan cards from a<em>single</em> additional clan in his or her
                    conflict deck.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Each copy of a card that is chosen reduces the amount of influence a player has
                    at his or her disposal to use in selecting other cards for the deck.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A clan-affiliated card that has no influence cost cannot be selected using
                    influence for inclusion in a deck.

                    on out-of-clan cards, as indicated by the Lion stronghold, Shiro no Yojin. He

                    select cards from the Crane Clan. Tom decides to include 3 copies of Admit
                    Defeat (2 influence cost each), 3 copies of The Perfect Gift (1 influence cost
                    each), and 1 copy of Duelist Training (1 influence cost). As this is all of
                    Tom's influence, he cannot include any other Crane Clan cards in his conflict
                    deck. All of the other cards in Tom's conflict deck must either be from the Lion
                    Clan, or be neutral.

                  Whenever a player wishes to play a card or initiate a triggered ability, that
                  player first declares his or her intent (and shows the card to be used, if
                  necessary). There are two preliminary confirmations that must be made before the
                  process may begin. These are:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Check play restrictions and verify the existence of eligible targets: can the
                    card be played, or the ability initiated, at this time? If the play restrictions
                    are not met, or there are not enough eligible targets for the ability, the
                    process cannot proceed.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Determine the cost (or costs, if multiple costs are required) to play the card
                    or initiate the ability. If it is established that the cost (taking modifiers
                    into account) can be paid, proceed with the remaining steps of this sequence.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  Once each of the preliminary confirmations has been made, follow these steps, in
                  order:
                </p>
                <ol start={3}>
                  <li>Apply any modifiers to the cost(s).</li>
                  <li>Pay the cost(s).</li>
                  <li>
                    Choose target(s), if applicable. Any pre-effect instructions to "select" among
                    multiple options in the ability are made at this time as well.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The card attempts to enter play, or the effects of the ability attempt to
                    initiate. An interrupt ability that cancels this initiation may be used at this
                    time.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The card enters play, or the effects of the ability (if not canceled in step 6)
                    complete their initiation, and resolve.
                  </li>
                  <li>At this time the card is considered "played" or the ability "triggered."</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  Interrupts and reactions may be used throughout this process as normal, should
                  their triggering conditions occur.

                  If the players are instructed to perform a sequence “in player order,” the first
                  player performs their part of the sequence first, followed by the player to the
                  first player’s left and continuing in clockwise order.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If a sequence performed in player order does not conclude after each player has
                    performed their aspect of the sequence once, the sequence of opportunities
                    continues to alternate from player to player in clockwise order until it is
                    complete.
                  </li>

                <p>
                  An interrupt is a triggered ability whose text is prefaced by a boldface "
                  <b>Interrupt:</b>" precursor. An interrupt ability interrupts the resolution of
                  its triggering condition, sometimes canceling or changing the resolution of that
                  condition. Always resolve interrupts to a triggering condition before resolving
                  the consequences of the triggering condition itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unlike actions, which are resolved during action windows, an interrupt may be
                  initiated only if its specified triggering condition occurs, as described in the
                  interrupt ability's text.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When a triggering condition initiates (but before it completes its resolution), an
                  interrupt window for that triggering condition opens.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Within the interrupt window, the first player always has the first opportunity to
                  initiate an eligible interrupt (to the triggering condition that opened the
                  window), or pass. Opportunities to initiate an eligible interrupt, or pass,
                  continue to alternate between the players until all players consecutively pass, at
                  which point the interrupt window closes. Passing does not prevent a player from
                  initiating an eligible interrupt later in that same interrupt window.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once an interrupt window closes, further interrupts to that specific triggering
                  condition cannot be initiated. The triggering condition now completes its
                  resolution (as long as its effects have not been canceled).
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Unless otherwise noted by the ability, each interrupt ability may be initiated
                    once each round. (This includes forced interrupts.)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    An interrupt with specified limit that enables it to be triggered more than once
                    per round may only be initiated once each time its specified triggering
                    condition occurs.
                  </li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If multiple players can trigger an interrupt ability, each may do so to the

                <p>
                  A keyword is a card ability which conveys specific rules to its card. The keywords
                  in the game are:
                  <a href="#ancestral">Ancestral</a>,<a href="#composure">Composure</a>,

                  <a href="#support">Support</a>.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Sometimes a keyword is followed by reminder text, which is presented in italics.
                    Reminder text is a shorthand explanation of how a keyword works, but it is not
                    rules text and does not replace the rules for that keyword in this glossary.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Keywords that resolve based on the occurrance of a triggering condition (such as
                    a character leaving play) resolve immediately after the triggering condition
                    occurs, before triggering any reaction abilities.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A card can have multiple instances of the same keyword. However, a card that
                    does so functions as if it has one instance of that keyword, and the keyword
                    will only resolve once per triggering condition. Variable keywords (see below)
                    are an exception: if a card has multiple instances of a variable keyword, each
                    of those instances acts on the card independently.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Some keywords, such as Composure, are variable keywords. Variable keywords
                    operate in the same way as other keywords, but their effects are unique on a
                    card-by-card basis. Each variable keyword has the same condition in which they
                    become active, but different effects based on the individual card’s text.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </article>

                <p>
                  Some abilities create conditions that affect the game state for a specified
                  duration. Such effects are known as lasting effects.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    A lasting effect persists beyond the resolution of the ability that created it,
                    for the duration specified by the effect. The effect continues to affect the
                    game state for the specified duration regardless of whether the card that
                    created the lasting effect is or remains in play.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If a lasting effect affects in-play cards (or a specified set of cards), it is
                    only applied to cards that are in play (or that meet the specifications of the
                    set) at the time the lasting effect is established. Cards that enter play (or

                  Some abilities may ask players to modify values. The game state constantly checks
                  and (if necessary) updates the count of any variable quantity that is being
                  modified.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Any time a new modifier is applied (or removed), the entire quantity is
                  recalculated from the start, considering the unmodified base value and all active
                  modifiers.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The calculation of a value treats all modifiers as being applied simultaneously.
                    However while performing the calculation, all additive and subtractive modifiers
                    should be calculated before doubling and/or halving modifiers are calculated.
                  </li>
                  <li>Fractional values are rounded up after all modifiers have been applied.</li>
                  <li>
                    When a value is "set" to a specific number, the set modifier overrides all
                    non-set modifiers (including any new non-set modifiers that are added during the
                    duration of the set value). If multiple set modifiers are in conflict, the most
                    recently applied set modifier takes precedence.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A quantity cannot be reduced so that it functions with a value below zero: a
                    card cannot have negative icons, political or military skill, glory, traits,
                    cost, or keywords. Negative modifiers that would take a value below zero can be
                    applied, but, after all active modifiers have been applied, any resultant value
                    below zero is treated as zero.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If a value “cannot be increased/decreased," any modifiers to that value that
                    would increase/decrease it are ignored for the duration of the “cannot be
                    increased/decreased" effect, even if those modifiers were applied before
                    applying the “cannot be increased/decreased" effect.

                  in his or her hand. When a player decides to mulligan, the mulliganed cards are
                  set aside, replaced with an equal number of cards from the top of the appropriate
                  deck(s), and then shuffled back into the deck(s) from which they originated.

                    her mind and then decide to mulligan during that step after seeing the

                <p>
                  Each time a triggering condition occurs, the following sequence is followed: (1)
                  execute any interrupts to that triggering condition, (2) resolve the triggering
                  condition itself, and then, (3) execute any reactions to that triggering
                  condition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Within this sequence, if the use of an interrupt or reaction leads to a new
                  triggering condition, the game pauses and starts a new sequence: (1) execute
                  interrupts to the new triggering condition, (2) resolve the new triggering
                  condition itself, and then, (3) execute reactions to the new triggering condition.
                  This is called a nested sequence. Once this nested sequence is completed, the game
                  returns to where it left off, continuing with the original triggering condition's
                  sequence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is possible that a nested sequence generates further triggering conditions (and
                  hence more nested sequences). There is no limit to the number of nested sequences
                  that may occur, but each nested sequence must complete before returning to the
                  sequence that spawned it. In effect, these sequences are resolved in a Last In,
                  First Out (LIFO) manner.

                  Any character that has been declared as an attacker or defender for a conflict is
                  considered participating in that conflict through its resolution, unless it is
                  removed by an ability or game effect.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Each character that is in play is either participating or not participating in
                    each conflict.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If an ability removes a character from a conflict or moves a character home,
                    that character is no longer participating in the conflict and is returned to its
                    controller's home area.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If a non-participating character is moved into a conflict, it is considered
                    participating on its controller's side.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If a participating character is bowed, it is still considered participating, but
                    will not contribute its skill toward the resolution of the conflict while in a
                    bowed state.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If a participating character leaves play for any reason, it is no longer
                    participating in the conflict.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A character played directly into a conflict from a player's hand is
                    participating in the conflict. The controller of the character must indicate
                    that this is the case when the character is played.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If a character "cannot participate" in a conflict, that character cannot be
                    declared as an attacker or defender for, move into, be played into, or put into
                    play in that conflict. If an already participating character gains "cannot
                    participate" status during a conflict, move it home bowed.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In the enlightenment format, only two players can control participating
                    characters: one attacking player and one defending player. The third player in
                    the game may take actions to influence the outcome of the conflict, but they
                    cannot play or move characters to the conflict on either side (except as
                    indicated by card effects).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In the team conquest format, all four players can control participating
                    characters. Characters controlled by players on the same team participate on the
                    same side of the conflict and contribute their skill towards the same total.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If a conflict does not have two participating players, it cannot resolve.
                    Therefore, if a player is eliminated from the game in the middle of a conflict
                    and the game does not end, the conflict immediately ends with no winner. Return
                    the ring to the attacker’s unclaimed ring pool (or the common unclaimed ring
                    pool, as appropriate) and each participating character controlled by the
                    remaining player returns home bowed.

                <p>
                  There are times in the game at which a player has an option to perform an act
                  (such as taking an action, triggering an ability, or executing a game step), or to
                  pass. Passing in such a situation forfeits the player's right to perform that act
                  in that moment.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The first player to pass the opportunity to use an action or play a card during
                    the dynasty phase forfeits the opportunity to do so for the remainder of the
                    phase, and gains one fate.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Other game sequences in which players have the option to pass continue until
                    both players pass consecutively. If the first player passes, and the second
                    player does not, the opportunity returns to the first player in the sequence.
                    The sequence only ends when both players have passed in succession. (In other
                    words, passing in such a sequence does not prevent a player from re-entering the
                    sequence should the opponent not also pass in succession.)

                    When passing an opportunity to declare a conflict, a player is not required to
                    specify which type of conflict he or she is passing.

                  Personal honor is a means of tracking the honored or dishonored status of
                  individual character cards. Each character exists in one of three states:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Honored</li>

                  <li>Dishonored</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Characters enter play with ordinary status. Honored status tokens and dishonored
                  status tokens are used to track the state of a character that receives a status
                  other than ordinary.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    When a character is honored, it receives an honored status token to indicate its
                    honored status. An honored character adds its glory value to both its military
                    and political skill so long as it possesses that token. When an honored
                    character leaves play its controller gains 1 honor.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When a character is dishonored, it receives a dishonored status token to
                    indicate its dishonored status. A dishonored character subtracts its glory value
                    from both its military and political skill so long as it possesses that token.
                    When a dishonored character leaves play its controller loses 1 honor.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When an honored character is dishonored, it loses its honored status, discards
                    the status token, and returns to ordinary status. Likewise, when a dishonored
                    character is honored, it loses its dishonored status, discards the status token,
                    and returns to ordinary status.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A character with an honored status token cannot become honored. A character with
                    a dishonored status token cannot become dishonored.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Should a character have both an honored status token and a dishonored status
                    token at the same time, discard both tokens. The character returns to the
                    ordinary state.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If a character enters play honored or dishonored, abilities cannot be triggered
                    from that character becoming honored or dishonored, as it enters play already
                    with that status.

                  <b>Play</b>ing a character or attachment card involves paying the card's fate cost
                  and placing the card in the play area. This causes the card to enter play. Cards
                  are played from a player's hand or provinces. Any time a character card is played,
                  its controller has the option of placing additional fate from his or her fate pool

                  immediately removed from the game, and their honor dial is ignored for the
                  purposes of card abilities for the rest of the game. If, after a player is
                  eliminated, only one player remains in the game, that player is the game’s winner.

                  A player’s provinces represent the lands under their domain. When a province is
                  attacked and turned faceup, the card represents what the enemy finds or encounters
                  upon first entering that province.

                  When playing the skirmish format, province tokens are used instead of province
                  cards. These tokens have no game text, no element, and 3 defense strength. They
                  are never considered to be facedown or faceup, and are never revealed.

                  <li>
                    A face-down province card is considered to be in play only as a face down
                    province, and its faceup side is unable to engage with the game state until the
                    province is revealed.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A non-broken, faceup province card is considered to be in play, and is engaged

                  <li>
                    A broken province is considered to have a blank text box, and its abilities

                  <li>
                    If a province has more than one card in it, those cards are considered to all be
                    in the same province. Characters and events can be played and holdings provide
                    their bonuses. Do not refill a province until it is empty.

                  <li>
                    Each player’s non-stronghold provinces are placed in a linear row in front of
                    that player. Each of those provinces is adjacent to the province immediately to
                    its left and right. A player’s stronghold province is not adjacent to any other
                    province.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Each province card has one or more elements associated with it. A province with
                    more than one element counts as a province of each of its elements at all times
                    and can be selected during deck construction to fulfill the province slot of any
                    of those elements.

                  <li>
                    A fivefold <i>tomoe</i> symbol used in place of a single element, such as on
                    Toshi Ranbo (Inheritance Cycle, 1), indicates that all five elements are
                    associated with that province.

                  <li>
                    During a conflict, a province is only considered to be an “eligible” province to
                    be attacked if it is controlled by the defending player. The provinces of any
                    non-defending players are not eligible to be attacked. A player cannot attack
                    their own province.

                  If card text includes a qualifier followed by multiple terms, the qualifier
                  applies to each item in the list, if it is applicable. For example, in the phrase
                  "each unique character and attachment," the word "unique" applies both to
                  "character" and to "attachment."

                  Rally is a keyword ability that appears on dynasty cards. When a card with the
                  rally keyword is revealed in a player’s provinces, that player fills the same
                  province faceup. Both cards are in the province together, and either can be played
                  as an action during the dynasty phase. Do not refill a province until it is empty.

                  A reaction is a triggered ability whose text is prefaced by a boldface "

                  initiating any reactions to that triggering condition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unlike actions, which are resolved during action windows, a reaction may be
                  initiated only if its specified triggering condition occurs, as described in the
                  reaction ability's text.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After a triggering condition resolves, a reaction window for that triggering
                  condition opens.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Within the reaction window, the first player always has the first opportunity to
                  initiate an eligible reaction (to the triggering condition that opened the
                  window), or pass. Opportunities to initiate an eligible reaction, or pass,
                  continue to alternate between the players until all players consecutively pass, at
                  which point the reaction window closes. Passing does not prevent a player from
                  initiating an eligible reaction later in that same reaction window.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once a reaction window closes, further reactions to that specific triggering
                  condition cannot be initiated.

                <p>
                  A replacement effect is an effect (usually an interrupt) that replaces the
                  resolution of a triggering condition with a different means of resolving the same
                  triggering condition, but in such a manner that the triggering condition is still
                  considered to occur for the purposes of paying non-sacrifice costs. The word
                  "instead" is frequently indicative of such an effect. After all interrupts to the
                  triggering condition have resolved and it is time to resolve the triggering
                  condition itself, the replacement effect resolves instead.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If multiple replacement effects are initiated against the same triggering
                    condition, the most recently initiated replacement effect is the one used for
                    the resolution of the triggering condition.

                  Some abilities instruct a player to “resolve an ability" or “resolve this ability

                    restricted attachments when the new attachment enters play.

                <p>
                  Rings, represented by double-sided tokens, are used to determine the type and
                  element of conflicts. Each ring exists in one or more of three states, as follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Unclaimed</b> &ndash; Each ring in the unclaimed ring pool is an unclaimed
                  ring, and is eligible to be selected by a player as a part of the process of
                  declaring a conflict.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Contested</b> &ndash; While a conflict is resolving, the ring that has been
                  selected by the attacker when the conflict was declared is placed on the attacked
                  province. This ring is known as the contested ring.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Claimed</b> &ndash; Each ring in a player's claimed ring pool is a claimed
                  ring.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    While performing a glory count, each player adds 1 to his or her total for each
                    ring in his or her claimed ring pool.
                  </li>
                  <li>During the fate phase, place 1 fate on each unclaimed ring.</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>This step is skipped when playing the skirmish format.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>
                    When a ring becomes the contested ring in a conflict, move all fate on that ring
                    to the attacking player's fate pool.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When a ring is claimed, it is still considered to be contested until all
                    reactions to its claiming have resolved.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A card effect that refers to “the [ELEMENT] ring" refers to any ring that has
                    that element.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When a player claims a ring in the enlightenment format, that ring is placed on
                    one of that player’s provinces. The ring is considered to be “claimed on that
                    province.” Rings claimed on a player’s provinces do not return to the unclaimed
                    ring pool during the fate phase. They are still considered to be in that
                    player’s claimed ring pool.
                  </li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      A player cannot have multiple rings of the same printed element claimed on
                      their provinces. If they would do so, the duplicate ring is not claimed and is
                      instead returned to the attacking player’s unclaimed ring pool (if contested)
                      or to the defending player’s unclaimed ring pool (if claimed on a broken
                      province).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      A player cannot claim a ring on their stronghold province unless their
                      stronghold province is eligible to be attacked by their opponents.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If a player breaks an opponent’s province during a conflict, they claim each
                      ring that was claimed on that province, distributing those rings among their
                      own provinces if able.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      When a card effect would cause a ring to move from a player’s claimed ring
                      pool to an unclaimed ring pool or vice-versa, both pools must belong to the
                      same player. During a conflict, card effects can only switch the contested
                      ring with rings in the claimed or unclaimed ring pools of the attacking
                      player.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>
                    In the team conquest format, each team has a shared claimed ring pool. For the
                    purposes of card and game effects, a team’s claimed ring pool counts as the
                    claimed ring pool of each player on that team.
                  </li>

                  Each time a player wins a conflict as the attacking player, he or she may resolve
                  the ring effect associated with the contested ring's element. The ring effects are
                  as follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Air</b>: Either take 1 honor from your opponent, or gain 2 honor from the
                  general token pool.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Earth</b>: Draw 1 card from your conflict deck and discard 1 random card from
                  your opponent's hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Fire</b>: Choose a character in play and either honor or dishonor that
                  character.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Water</b>: Either choose a character and ready it, or choose a character with
                  no fate on it and bow it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Void</b>: Choose a character and remove 1 fate from it.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Whenever a player resolves a ring effect for a ring that has multiple elements,
                    that player may choose among those elements when the conflict's ring effect
                    resolves.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When a player is instructed to resolve multiple ring effects, they resolve each
                    effect (or pass on that effect) in its entirety before resolving the next ring
                    effect.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When playing the skirmish format, the following three rings have the following
                    effects instead:
                  </li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>

                      <b>Earth</b>: Either draw 1 card from your conflict deck or discard 1 random

                    <li>
                      <b>Water</b>: Choose a character in any player’s home area with 1 or fewer
                      fate on it and either ready or bow it.

                  A role card is placed alongside a player's stronghold, and provides specialized
                  abilities and limitations for that player's deck. A player may use a single role
                  card in conjunction with his or her stronghold while assembling a deck. The role
                  card starts the game next to its owner's stronghold and is revealed along with the
                  stronghold during setup.
                </p>
                <p>Role cards are not used in the skirmish format.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Role cards are not considered in play. Their text affects the game state from
                    the out-of-play area while they are active beside a player's stronghold.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Some cards have the text, "___ role only." This is a deckbuilding restriction,

                  If a player attempts to fill or refill one of their provinces or to draw a card
                  from their conflict deck and no cards remain in the deck, that player loses 5
                  honor, then shuffles the corresponding discard pile and places it facedown to form
                  a new dynasty or conflict deck. That player then continues to (re)fill the

                  When a player is instructed to sacrifice a card, that player must select a card in
                  play that he or she controls and that matches the requirements of the sacrifice,
                  and place it in his or her discard pile.

                  <li>

                  <li>
                    Sacrificing a card does not satisfy other means (such as "discard") of a card
                    leaving play.

                  When a player is instructed to search for a card, that player is permitted to look
                  at all of the cards in the searched area without revealing those cards to his or
                  her opponent.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If an effect searches an entire deck, the deck must be shuffled to the
                    satisfaction of the opponent upon completion of the search.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A player is not obliged to find the object of a search effect, even if the
                    searched cards contain a card that meets the eligibility requirements of the
                    search.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If a search effect would add a card with specified characteristics to a hidden
                    game area, the player fulfilling the search must reveal the card to his or her
                    opponent to verify that the card is eligible to be found by the search.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    While a game area (or a part of a game area) is being searched, the cards being
                    searched are considered to still be in that game area.

                <p>Some abilities instruct a player to select among multiple options.</p>

                  <li>
                    If a selection is required before the effect of the ability resolves (i.e.,
                    before the dash), the selection is made during the same timing step in which
                    targets are chosen.

                  The word "shuffle" is used as a shorthand that instructs a player to shuffle a

                <p>
                  A status token can be placed on a card to alter its status during a game. These
                  include honored status tokens, dishonored status tokens and tainted status tokens.
                  Each kind of status token has a different effect on the card it is placed on.
                </p>
                <li>
                  Honored status tokens are used to indicate a character’s honored status. A
                  character with an honored status token adds its glory to each of its skills. That
                  character’s controller gains 1 honor when that character leaves play.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Dishonored status tokens are used to indicate a character’s dishonored status. A
                  character with a dishonored status token subtracts its glory from each of its
                  skills. That character’s controller loses 1 honor when that character leaves play,
                </li>
                <li>
                  Tainted status tokens are used to indicate that a character or province has been
                  tainted by the Shadowlands. A character with a tainted status token gets +2
                  <span className="icon icon-conflict-military" /> and +2
                  <span className="icon icon-conflict-political" />, but its controller must lose 1
                  honor when it is declared as an attacker or defender in a conflict. A province
                  with a tainted status token gets +2 strength, but its controller must lose 1 honor
                  when they declare 1 or more defenders during conflicts at that province.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Dishonored status tokens can be placed on provinces by card abilities. A province
                  with a dishonored status token is treated as if its printed text box were blank
                  (except for Traits) while the token is on that province.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A status token cannot be removed from a card unless it is a character whose
                  personal honor is changed (see Personal Honor, Personal Dishonor on page 15) or a
                  card effect specifically moves or removes that status token.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a card effect “moves” or “discards” an honored or dishonored status token from
                  a character, that character has not been honored or dishonored for the purposes of
                  card abilities, even though it loses its honored/dishonored status.

                  A player's stronghold is considered in play. A stronghold card cannot leave play,
                  move from the stronghold province, be turned facedown, or change control.

                <p>
                  The support keyword introduced in the <i>Clan War</i> expansion allows multiple
                  players to pay the fate cost of a card together. When a player plays a card with
                  the support keyword, another player may choose to help pay the card’s fate cost.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    When a player is playing a card with the support keyword, they may solicit the
                    other players in the game to see if any player wishes to contribute to paying
                    the card’s fate cost. Alternatively, another player may offer to contribute
                    fate.

                  <li>
                    The player who helps pay the cost of a card with the support keyword is

                  <li>
                    No other player is ever obligated to pay for a card with the support keyword.
                    The player playing a card with the support keyword is never obligated to accept

                  <li>
                    If a player attempts to play a card with the support keyword that they cannot
                    fully pay for and no other player supports them to help pay for the card, it
                    remains unplayed in that player’s hand. They pay none of the card’s costs.

                  The tainted status token allows characters and provinces to become tainted by the
                  corrupting presence of Jigoku.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When a card ability or ring effect would taint a character, place a tainted status
                  token on it. A tainted character cannot be tainted again.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Each character that is tainted gets +2
                  <span className="icon icon-conflict-military" /> and +2
                  <span className="icon icon-conflict-political" />. As an additional cost to
                  declare a tainted character as an attacker or defender in a conflict, its
                  controller must lose 1 honor.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Each province that is tainted gets +2 strength. As an additional cost to declare

                  must lose 1 honor.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once a card is tainted, that tainted status cannot be removed unless a card
                  ability discards (or moves) its status token. If a tainted province is turned
                  faceup or facedown, do not discard its tainted status token.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A character’s tainted status has no bearing on its personal honor, and a tainted

                  (usually a card) that meets the targeting requirements of the ability.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The controller of a targeting ability chooses all targets for the effect unless
                    otherwise specified by the card.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If an ability requires the choosing of one or more targets, and there are not
                    enough valid targets to meet all of its targeting requirements, the ability
                    cannot be initiated. This initiation check is made at the same time the
                    ability's play restrictions are checked.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    At the time targets are chosen, any currently valid targets are eligible to be
                    chosen. (This choice is not restricted only to targets that were present during
                    the initiation check.)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If multiple targets are required to be chosen by the same player, these are
                    chosen simultaneously.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Most card abilities that initiate a duel (see
                    <a href="#duel-timing">Duel Timing</a>) use the phrase “initiate a [type] duel."
                    The characters chosen during duel initiation are considered to be chosen as
                    targets of the ability that initiates the duel.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    An ability that can choose “any number" of targets, or “up to X" targets, can
                    successfully resolve if zero such targets are chosen, unless choosing zero such
                    targets would cause the resolution of the ability’s effect to not change the
                    game state in any way.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Some abilities require the choice of a target that is not directly affected by
                    the ability — the target is instead chosen as a reference point for the
                    resolution of the ability. This is referred to as a “referential target."
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A card is not an eligible target for an ability if the resolution of that
                    ability's effect could not affect the target at all, unless it is a referential
                    target.
                    <em>
                      (For example, a bowed character cannot be chosen as the target for an ability
                      that reads "<b>Action:</b> Choose a character &ndash; bow that character.")
                    </em>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A card is only eligible to be chosen as a referential target for an ability if
                    that ability’s effect (using the referential target) would result in a change of
                    game state.
                    <em>
                      (For example, a character with no attachments cannot be chosen as the target
                      for an ability that reads “<b>Action:</b> Choose a character — discard each
                      attachment on that character.")
                    </em>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The resolution of some effects (such as post-then effects, or delayed effects)
                    requires that targets are chosen after the initiation of the effect. Such
                    targets need not be verified when checking play restrictions and determining
                    whether or not the entire ability may initiate. If there are no valid targets at
                    the time such targets would be chosen, that aspect of the effect fails to
                    resolve.

                <p>
                  During the course of an enlightenment format game, players may find themselves in
                  situations where a mutually beneficial agreement called a treaty can be made. In
                  addition to setting up the terms of the treaty, both players agree on value to
                  stake on the treaty (by default, an amount of honor). If either player breaks
                  their part of a treaty, that player must suffer consequences based on the value
                  staked on the treaty.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When two players are setting up a treaty, each of the following parameters must be
                  specified. Those players may discuss and determine these parameters in any order,
                  but each parameter must be agreed upon by both involved players before a treaty
                  can be finalized. The parameters are as follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>What is Being Promised by Each Player:</b> When making a promise for a treaty,
                  a player offers something they are going to do, or not do, during the course of
                  the game. This promise must be an action or a decision that a player can take and
                  cannot include an exchange of game components (honor, fate, cards, or claimed
                  rings).
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Duration:</b> When a treaty is established, both involved players must agree to
                  a duration for how long the treaty is going to last. This duration can be of any
                  length, from “immediate” to “the remainder of the game.” Once a treaty’s duration
                  has ended it either is dissolved (if both players have kept their promises), or it
                  is broken (if one player did not do what they promised in the specified
                  timeframe), causing the player that broke the treaty to suffer the consequences.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Value:</b> Both involved players must agree upon value to stake on the treaty
                  (between 1 and 5). If during the course of play, the treaty between the two
                  players is broken by either player, the player that broke the treaty suffers a
                  penalty based on the value staked on the treaty. By default, this comes in the
                  form of losing that amount of honor, though it may be defined by a treaty card.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    After a treaty has been broken, the players are no longer bound by the promises
                    they made when establishing the treaty.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Each player can form a treaty with any number of other players, but each pair of
                    players may only have one treaty active between them at any given time. If a
                    treaty between two players has dissolved, or been broken, a new treaty may be
                    formed between those players.

                <p>
                  Treaty cards are included in the Clan War expansion and can be used to increase
                  variety when playing the enlightenment format. To use these cards, shuffle them
                  into a treaty deck at the start of the game and set it within reach of all
                  players. These replace the default method of staking honor on treaties.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whenever two players agree on a treaty, they place the top card of the treaty deck
                  facedown between them without looking at it and mark the value staked on the
                  treaty. When a player breaks that treaty, they reveal the card and resolve its
                  text. Note that any treaty card that refers to “the player who did not break this
                  treaty” refers only to the single other player with whom the treaty was made.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After a treaty is broken (and its effects resolved) or fulfilled (and its effects
                  unrevealed), put that treaty card on the bottom of the the treaty deck.

                  A boldface timing command followed by a colon indicates that an ability is a
                  triggered ability. Triggered abilities fall into one of the following types:
                  actions, interrupts, and reactions. Some interrupt and reaction abilities are also
                  forced.

                    Unless the timing command is prefaced by the word "Forced," all triggered
                    abilities are optional. They can be triggered (or not) by their controller at
                    the ability's appropriate timing point. Forced triggered abilities are triggered
                    automatically by the game at the ability's appropriate timing point.

                      <li>
                        Any targets that must be chosen in the resolution of a card’s “Forced”
                        ability are chosen by the controller of that card.

                    triggered once per round. This limit is player specific.
                  </li>
                  <li>

                    into play as the effect is being resolved.

                  <li>
                    If a triggered ability has no dash, the ability has no pre-dash content, and the
                    entirety of the ability is considered an effect.

                  <li>
                    A triggered ability can only be initiated if its <i>effect</i> has the potential

                    into account the consequences of the cost payment or the consequences of any
                    other ability interactions.

                <p>
                  A triggering condition is a condition which dictates when an ability can be
                  triggered. On card abilities, the triggering condition is the element of the
                  ability that references such a condition, which most often comes in the form of a
                  specific occurrence that takes place during the game. This indicates the timing
                  point at which the ability may be used. The description of an ability's triggering
                  condition often follows the word "when" (for interrupt abilities) or the word
                  "after" (for reaction abilities), or the word "if" (for action abilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If a single occurrence creates multiple triggering conditions for reactions or
                  interrupts (such as a single Earth ring effect causing a player to draw a card and
                  another player to discard a card), those triggering conditions are handled in
                  shared interrupt/reaction windows, in which abilities that refer to any of the
                  triggering conditions created by that occurrence may be used in any order.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The following is a sequence of possible interrupt and reaction opportunities that
                  exists around each triggering condition that may arise in a game:
                </p>
                <ol>

                    The triggering condition becomes imminent. (Meaning that if it is not canceled,
                    changed, or otherwise preempted by interrupt abilities, the triggering condition
                    is the next thing that will occur in the game.)

                    Interrupt abilities that reference when the imminent triggering condition
                    "would" occur may be used. (<b>Note</b>: For effects, a "cancel" interrupt may
                    prevent the effect from initiating, and the initiation of the effect is a
                    separate triggering condition that precedes the effect's resolution. "Cancel"
                    interrupts are the only type that will reference the initiation of an effect.)
                    If the imminent triggering condition is canceled, none of the subsequent steps
                    in this sequence occur. If the triggering condition is changed, the original
                    condition is no longer imminent, but the new triggering condition is now
                    imminent.

                    the imminent triggering condition opens. It closes after all players

                  A card with the <span className="icon icon-unique" /> symbol in front of its title
                  is a unique card. Each player may only have a maximum of one instance of each
                  unique card, by title, in play.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    A player cannot take control of or bring into play a unique card if he or she
                    already controls or owns another in-play card with the same title or printed
                    title.

                  <li>
                    A player cannot bring into play a unique card owned by his or her opponent if
                    that opponent controls an in-play card with the same title or printed title.

                    As a player action during the dynasty phase, a player may discard a copy (by
                    title) of a unique character from his or her hand or provinces to place 1 fate
                    on an in-play copy of that unique character he or she controls.

                    In team games, the rules listed above apply to a team instead of a player
                    (players on the same team may only have a maximum of one instance of each unique
                    card, by title, in play at any time).

                    While two or more players on a team control more than one copy of a unique
                    stronghold, province card, or holding, treat each copy of that card as if its
                    printed text box were blank and as if it had a strength or bonus strength of 0.

                  A conflict is unopposed if the attacking player wins the conflict and the
                  defending player controls no defending characters at the time the conflict winner

                    Each time the defending player loses an unopposed conflict in the stronghold
                    format, that player loses 1 honor. The lost honor is returned to the general
                    token pool. This occurs during framework{' '}

                    In the team conquest format, a conflict is only considered unopposed if no
                    player on the defending team controls any defending characters at the time the
                    attacking team wins the conflict. If that is the case, each player on the

                  Each conflict is won by the player who counts the highest total skill applicable

                    A player must count at least 1 total skill and there must be at least one

                    If the total skill counted on each side is tied at a value of 1 or greater (and

                  The word "would" is used to define the triggering condition of some interrupt
                  abilities, and establishes a higher priority for those abilities than interrupts
                  to the same triggering condition that lack the word "would."

                <p>
                  All "would be X" interrupts are eligible to be used before any "is X" interrupts.
                  This means that an interrupt with the word "would" (such as "when a character
                  would leave play") has timing priority over an interrupt without the word "would"
                  that references that same occurrence (such as "when a character leaves play").
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If an interrupt to a triggering condition that would occur changes the nature of
                    that which is about to occur, no further interrupts to the original triggering
                    condition may be used, as that triggering condition is no longer imminent.

                This section provides a detailed overview of the phases and framework steps of an

                Numbered (or lettered) items presented in the darker <b>grey</b> boxes are known as
                framework steps. Framework steps are mandatory occurrences dictated by the structure

                windows are special framework steps that indicate the possibility of the game
                returning to an earlier framework step in the chart. These repetitive sequences can
                end in various ways, such as when all players have performed the steps in a
                sequence, or when a player makes a specific decision. Each purple window explains
                when and how the game either loops back or progresses to a later framework step.

                presented in lighter <b>orange</b> boxes on the chart. When most action windows
                open, the player or team with the first player token has the first opportunity to
                initiate an action, or pass. The one exception to this is the action window during
                the conflict phase, in which the defending player (or team) has the first
                opportunity to initiate an action, or pass. Opportunities to initiate actions
                alternate between the players in player order until all players consecutively pass,
                at which point the action window closes and the game advances to the next step on
                the timing chart. Note that if a player passes their opportunity to act, but any
                other opponent does not consecutively pass in sequence, the original player may
                still take an action when the alternation of action opportunities returns to the
                player who had passed.
              </p>
              <p>Resolve each action completely before the next action opportunity.</p>
              <p>
                During each action window, players are permitted to play character and attachment
                cards from hand. The one exception to this is step 1.4, during which playing
                character and attachment cards from hand is prohibited.

                A reaction ability to a framework effect may be initiated immediately after the

                To play a character from a province, a player removes a number of fate equal to the
                character's fate cost from his or her fate pool, and returns that fate to the
                general token pool. The character enters play and is placed in the player's home
                area. The player then has the option to place any number of additional fate from his
                or her fate pool onto that character. Once this option to place additional fate has
                been completed or passed, the province from which the character was played is
                refilled facedown from the dynasty deck.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a player passes, that player relinquishes all further opportunities to act
                during this phase. (A player who has passed may still trigger interrupts and
                reactions to any eligible occurrence.) The player to pass first gains 1 fate from
                the general token pool and adds it to his or her fate pool. After one player has
                passed, the other player may continue to use action opportunities until he or she
                also passes. Once both players have passed, this step is complete.

                The end of a phase is an important game milestone that may be referenced in card
                text, either as a point at which an ability may or must resolve, or as a point at
                which a lasting effect or constant ability expires or begins.

              <p>
                Each player secretly selects a number from 1 to 5 on his or her honor dial as his or
                her honor bid for this round. Once both players have confirmed that they are ready,
                proceed to the next step.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In the skirmish format, players cannot select a number higher than 3 on their
                  honor dial.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <AnchoredHeading addHeading={addHeading} level="3" text="2.3. Reveal honor dials" />
              <p>The players simultaneously reveal their bids.</p>
              <p>
                Once a player reveals an honor bid, the dial is placed next to the player's
                stronghold or conflict deck and remains as a reference point until the next honor
                bid occurs.
              </p>
              <AnchoredHeading addHeading={addHeading} level="3" text="2.4. Transfer honor" />
              <p>
                The player with the higher honor bid must give an amount of honor to the player with
                the lower honor bid that is equal to the difference between the two bids. If the
                bids are equal, no honor is transferred during this step.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In the enlightenment format, all three players compare their honor bids with one
                  another for the purposes of transferring honor.
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If each player selects a different number on their honor dial, the player who
                    selects the highest number gives honor to the player who selects the lowest
                    number. The amount of honor given is equal to the difference between the numbers
                    those two players select. The player whose number is in between the other two
                    does not gain or lose honor.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If two players select the same number and the remaining player selects a number
                    that is higher than that selected by their two opponents, the player that
                    selected the higher number gives honor to both opponents. The amount of honor
                    given is equal to the difference between the two numbers selected, divided as
                    evenly as possible between the two players that selected the same number. If any
                    honor remains to be given after dividing the honor as evenly as possible, the
                    player giving the honor selects which opponent the remaining honor is given to.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If two players select the same number and the remaining player selects a number
                    that is lower than that selected by their two opponents, the player that
                    selected the lower number takes honor from both opponents. The total amount of
                    honor taken is equal to the difference between the two numbers selected, divided
                    as evenly as possible between the two players that selected the same number. If
                    any honor remains to be taken after dividing it as evenly as possible, the
                    player receiving the honor selects which opponent to take the remaining honor
                    from.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  In the team conquest format, each player only compares their honor bid with that
                  of the opponent sitting across from them for the purposes of transferring honor.

              <p>
                Each player simultaneously draws a number of cards from their conflict deck equal to
                their honor bid.

              <p>
                During the conflict phase, each player is granted one or more opportunities to
                declare a conflict. These conflict opportunities alternate between players with
                remaining conflict opportunities in player order until each player has declared a
                conflict or passed on each of their conflict opportunities. In the team conquest
                format, conflict opportunities are given to each team instead of each player.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the stronghold, enlightenment, and team conquest formats, each player (or team)
                is granted one opportunity to declare a military conflict and one opportunity to
                declare a political conflict. A player’s military and political conflicts may be
                declared in either order during the round. In the skirmish format, each player is
                granted one opportunity to declare a conflict of either type.
              </p>
              <p>When a player has an opportunity to declare a conflict, that player may:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Declare a military conflict.</li>
                <li>Declare a political conflict.</li>
                <li>Pass.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                If a conflict opportunity is passed, the player forfeits his or her right to use
                that opportunity this phase.
              </p>
              <p>In order to declare a conflict, the attacking player must:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Declare the type and element of the conflict to be initiated. This is indicated
                    by selecting a ring from the unclaimed ring pool (this ring is known as the
                    contested ring, and defines the element of the conflict), and placing it on an
                    opponent's eligible unbroken province (this indicates which province is being
                    attacked) with either the military side or the political side faceup (the faceup
                    side of the contested ring defines the type of the conflict).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A conflict cannot be declared against a player’s stronghold province in the
                    stronghold or enlightenment formats unless at least three of that player’s
                    non-stronghold provinces are broken. A conflict cannot be declared against a
                    player’s stronghold province in the team conquest format unless that player’s
                    team controls at least 3 broken provinces and at least one of that player’s
                    non-stronghold provinces is broken.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If a player selects an unclaimed ring with fate on it to become the contested
                    ring, that fate is moved from the ring to the attacking player's fate pool.
                  </p>

                  <li>
                    In the enlightenment format, a player can only declare a conflict using a ring
                    in their personal unclaimed ring pool or the common unclaimed ring pool.
                  </li>

                  Declare which <b>ready</b> characters (under his or her control) are being
                  committed as attackers. The attacking player may declare any number of eligible
                  characters under his or her control as attackers. Slide these characters toward
                  the center of the play area, away from the attacking player's home area. At least
                  one character must be declared as an attacker at this time in order to initiate a
                  conflict. If any of the attackers have the covert keyword, the targets for covert
                  are chosen at this time.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    In the team conquest format, each player on the attacking team may declare
                    attackers in the same conflict, and those characters participate on the same
                    side together.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Each of the above items are considered to be performed simultaneously. If any of the
                above cannot be completed, the conflict cannot be initiated.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the province being attacked is facedown, turn it faceup as soon as a conflict is
                successfully declared against it. This occurs before any reactions to the process of
                conflict declaration may be triggered.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once a conflict has been declared, resolve that conflict before the next conflict is
                declared.
              </p>
              <p>
                If no player has a conflict opportunity remaining when this step is reached, advance

                The defending player declares which &ndash; if any &ndash; ready characters (under
                his or her control) are being committed as defenders. The defending player may
                declare any number of eligible characters under his or her control as defenders.
                Slide these characters toward the center of the play area, away from the defending
                player's home area. Declaring "no defenders" is also an option.

                <li>
                  In the team conquest format, the controller of the attacked province may declare
                  one or more defenders if they choose, and each other player on their team may
                  declare up to one one defender. Those characters participate on the same side

                This is a special action window in which the defending player (rather than the first

                the players until both players consecutively pass.

              <p>With an action opportunity, a player may:</p>

                <li>Play an event card with an action trigger from his or her hand.</li>
                <li>
                  Play an attachment card from hand, and attach it to any eligible character in

                </li>
                <li>
                  Play a character from hand, into the conflict, participating on that player's
                  side. (Additional fate from the player's fate pool may be placed on the character
                  at this time.)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Play a character from hand into his or her home area. (Additional fate from the

                After using an action opportunity, a player must announce the total relevant skill
                present on both sides of the conflict that would be counted if the conflict were to
                resolve with no further actions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once both players consecutively pass their action opportunities, proceed to the next

              />
              <p>
                The conflict type indicates which skill value is used to resolve the conflict.
                During a military conflict use military skill. During a political conflict use
                political skill.
              </p>
              <p>
                First, determine the attacking player's total skill in the conflict by adding
                together the skill (that matches the conflict type) of each ready attacking
                character and factor in all active modifiers. Then determine the defending player's
                total skill in the conflict by adding together the skill (that matches the conflict
                type) of each ready defending character and factor in all active modifiers.
              </p>
              <p>
                The player whose side has the higher total skill wins the conflict. In order to win
                a conflict, a player must count a total skill of 1 or higher. In the case of a tie,
                the conflict is won by the attacking player. If both players count 0 skill, the
                conflict resolves with no winner, and the ring is returned to the pool of unclaimed
                rings.

                  In the team conquest format, players win or lose the conflict as a team,
                  regardless of who controls participating characters. Any card abilities that
                  trigger when a player wins a conflict can be triggered if that player’s team wins
                  a conflict (the same is true for losing a conflict), as each player on that team
                  counts as having won the conflict.

              </ul>
              <AnchoredHeading addHeading={addHeading} level="3" text="3.2.4. Apply unopposed" />
              <p>
                If the attacking player won the conflict and the defending player controls no
                defending characters (in step 3.2.3), the conflict is considered "unopposed." If
                playing the stronghold or team conquest format, the defending player loses 1 honor
                and returns it to the general token pool.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the defending player or no player won the conflict, nothing happens during this
                step.

                If the attacking player won the conflict by an amount equal to or greater than the
                strength of the attacked province (in step 3.2.3), the province is broken. Rotate
                the province 180 degrees or discard the province token to indicate this.

                  In the team conquest format, the Air and Earth ring effects may only be resolved
                  against the opponent whose province is being attacked, and only a single player on

              <p>
                The players then compare their totals. The player with the higher total wins the

                  total is compared to that of the opposing team, and one of the two teams wins the
                  glory count if the totals are not tied.

                The player who won the glory count (in step 3.4.1) claims the Imperial Favor by
                taking the Imperial Favor card, setting it to its military side or to its political
                side, and placing it next to his or her stronghold. That player is said to "have the
                Imperial Favor," and the card may influence the following game round. If a player
                who already has the Imperial Favor claims it again, the player may set it to either
                side.
              </p>
              <p>
                If players have the same total, the Imperial Favor remains in its current state
                (either unclaimed or under the possession of the player who currently has it,
                remaining set on its current side).

                When a card ability initiates a duel, part of the cost of that ability may use the
                phrase, “initiate a [type] duel." This opens the duel timing window.
              </p>
              <p>
                To initiate a duel, the player resolving the card ability must choose two characters
                to duel against each other: one they control and one controlled by an opponent. The
                following parameters exist on which characters can be chosen for the duel:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  One character must be controlled by the player whose card ability initiates the
                  duel, and one character must be controlled by an opponent of that player.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a duel is initiated during a conflict, both characters chosen must be
                  participating.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a duel is initiated by an ability on a character card, that character is
                  automatically involved in the duel. Some abilities use the phrase “this character
                  initiates" as a reminder of this. That character is not considered to be chosen as
                  a target of the duel, as it is already involved.
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    During a conflict, a duel can only be initiated by an ability on a character
                    card if that character is participating in the conflict.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
              <p>
                If this process is completed, a duel has been initiated. Otherwise, the duel fails
                to initiate and cannot resolve.

                A duel is resolved during the successful resolution of any triggered ability that

                opponent’s character to a [type] duel." To resolve a duel, perform the following

                characters that are involved in the duel, as well as the kind of duel that will take
                place. This statistic (<span className="icon icon-conflict-military" /> skill,{' '}
                <span className="icon icon-conflict-political" /> skill, or glory) will be used to
                determine the results of the duel.

              <p>
                Each player secretly selects a number from 1 to 5 on his or her honor dial as his or
                her honor bid for this duel. Once both players have confirmed that they are ready,
                proceed to the next step.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In the skirmish format, players cannot select a number higher than 3 on their
                  honor dial.

              <p>The players simultaneously reveal their bids.</p>
              <p>
                Once a player reveals an honor bid, the dial is placed next to the player’s
                stronghold or conflict deck and remains as a reference point until the next honor
                bid occurs.

              <p>
                The player with the higher honor bid must give an amount of honor to the player with
                the lower honor bid that is equal to the difference between the two bids. If the
                bids are equal, no honor is transferred during this step.

              <p>
                The process of initiating the duel (in step D.1) will have established which
                statistic (<span className="icon icon-conflict-military" /> skill,{' '}
                <span className="icon icon-conflict-political" /> skill, or glory) is being used to
                determine the results of the duel. Each player calculates the current value of that
                statistic for their character involved in the duel. Any skill modifiers that were
                active at the time the duel was initiated are still applicable during the duel.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  If multiple characters are involved in the duel on the same side, add their
                  dueling statistics together. The value calculated in this step is treated as the
                  skill value of a single character for the purposes of determining duel results.
                  Those characters win or lose the duel together

              <p>
                Each player calculates their duel total and compares it with that of their opponent
                to determine the results.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the stronghold, enlightenment, and team conquest formats, each player adds their
                duel honor bid to the statistic value they calculated in step D.6 to determine their
                duel total.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the skirmish format, the player with the higher dueling statistic value
                calculated in step D.6 adds 1 to their honor bid to determine their duel total. The
                other player’s duel total is equal to their honor bid and is not increased by the
                dueling statistic.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The character whose controller has the higher duel total is the duel’s winner.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The character whose controller has the lower duel total is the duel’s loser.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the duel totals are the same, neither character is the duel’s winner and
                  neither character is the duel’s loser.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                The ability that initiated the duel (in step D.1) specified the consequences of this
                duel for the winning and/or losing characters, or for the player(s) controlling
                those characters. Apply those consequences during this step.

              <p>
                This step formalizes the end of the duel. Return to the action window in which the
                duel was initiated, with the next player in the sequence of actions having the next
                opportunity to act.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>NOTE</b>: There are no action windows during a duel, so players are not able to
                initiate actions or play characters and attachments from their hands during the
                resolution of a duel. Applicable interrupt and/or reaction abilities may be
                triggered during a duel.

              </h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  When Display of Power is played, it produces a delayed effect that cancels the
                  normal effects of ring resolution during step 3.2.6 “Resolve Ring Effects" and
                  replaces it with “resolve the ring effect as if you had won the conflict as the
                  attacking player." Losing honor for unopposed and breaking the province will occur
                  before resolving Display of Power’s effect.
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Should Pilgrimage (Core, 22) not be broken when Display of Power resolves, the
                    delayed effect of Display takes precedence over Pilgrimage, canceling the normal
                    resolution of “Resolve Ring Effects" and replacing it with the adjusted means of
                    resolution. However, the Pilgrimage effect (“cancel all ring effects") still
                    cancels the Display of Power’s attempt to resolve the ring for the defender. The
                    defender claims the ring.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Because Display of Power interacts with the “Resolve Ring Effects" step rather
                    than the specific effect chosen by the attacker, the attacker does not have the
                    option to choose a specific ring effect to resolve when Seeker of Knowledge
                    (Core, 171) is attacking (or whether they would like to resolve a ring effect at
                    all). When Display of Power resolves the ring effect, the defender has the
                    opportunity to choose which ring effect they would like to resolve instead, and
                    may choose to not resolve the ring’s effect if they desire.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    When Banzai!’s effect initiates during the step 6 of playing the card (see page
                    11), the effects that initiate are: “you may lose 1 honor, the chosen character
                    gets +2
                    <span className="icon icon-conflict-military" /> , and if you lost 1 honor
                    resolve this ability twice." If Banzai!’s effects are canceled at this time,
                    none of those things happen and the card’s effects do not resolve at all. <br />
                    <br />
                    If those effects resolve, and the 1 honor is lost, “resolve this ability twice"
                    causes the ability’s resolution to return to step 5 (“choose a participating
                    character"). This causes the effects to initiate a second time, and thus they
                    can be canceled a second time to prevent the second +2

                  After you play an interrupt or reaction event that targets a character with Dragon
                  Tattoo attached, the tattoo can be used to play that event again. The interrupt or
                  reaction event is played during the interrupt/reaction window that the card was
                  originally played in.

                    When an interrupt or reaction is played in this way, it is “queued" into the
                    appropriate interrupt/reaction window, but is not actually played until the
                    reaction window for playing the original event closes. Therefore, cards like
                    Watch Commander (Core, 133) will trigger after the first instance of the event
                    but before the second instance of the event—this is different from when Dragon
                    Tattoo plays an action event, as an Action event (such as Hurricane Punch
                    (Elemental Cycle, 17)) is fully played and resolved within the resolution of
                    Dragon Tattoo’s ability.

                  If a participating character’s skill values are dependent upon players’ honor

                  totals in step 3.2.3 before fully resolving that step by changing those players’
                  bids and potentially changing which player wins or loses the conflict due to the

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Because interrupts resolve before their triggering condition (page 11), and
                    because “would" effects have the capability to change the triggering condition
                    (page 20), Toshimoko’s ability has the potential to change the outcome of step
                    3.2.3. Therefore, if: a character’s skill values are dependent upon the players’
                    honor bids, Toshimoko’s duel changes those bids, and he loses the duel, then it
                    is possible that Toshimoko could lose the duel but win the conflict (if up
                    against a Sincere Challenger (Children of the Empire, 27) who loses composure in
                    a political conflict, for example, or by being honored by Kyūden Kakita (Masters
                    of the Court, 1)). It is also possible that recalculating skill values for step
                    3.2.3 due to Toshimoko’s ability could cause a province that would originally be
                    breaking to no longer be breaking if the loss of skill (or increase of
                    Toshimoko’s skill) causes the attacking player to not have the excess skill

                    receiving dishonored status tokens. Because selecting options happens during the
                    same step as choosing targets, the For Shame is still in the opponent’s hand
                    when the selection is made, and an option whose effect would fail to change the

                    When resolving this stronghold’s ability, the process of declaring a conflict is
                    inverted. The conflict begins with the declaration of defenders, which means the
                    defending characters will be participating in the conflict before the attacking
                    characters are declared (and before there is an attacked province, a conflict
                    type, or a contested ring). Because there is no conflict type when defenders are
                    declared, any character may be declared as a defender. If the conflict type
                    chosen by the attacking player would result in an ineligible defender—for
                    example, because the defender has a dash skill value for the declared conflict
                    type—then that character moves home bowed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When declaring attackers, the attacking player must choose a number of attacking
                    characters equal to the number chosen when paying the cost of Seven Stings
                    Keep’s ability. If a number was chosen greater than the number of eligible
                    attackers, the attacking player must declare the greatest number of possible
                    attackers. This may force the attacking player to select a particular ring or
                    conflict type to make the declaration of the required number of attackers
                    eligible. For example, if a character has a dash{' '}
                    <span className="icon icon-conflict-military" /> skill value and it must be
                    declared to reach the chosen number of attackers, then a{' '}
                    <span className="icon icon-conflict-political" /> conflict must be declared.

                  do not reshuffle their discard pile to keep revealing more cards. They only put

                  player to resolve each of the contested ring’s effects if they win the conflict.
                  This delayed effect occurs during step 3.2.3 of conflict resolution, at which
